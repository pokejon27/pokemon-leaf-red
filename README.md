I took Fire Red and randomized every Pokemon evolution line's typings, then redid their front sprites, movesets, and abilities based on that new typing. 
Here you'll find the base game with only the typings changed and nothing else, 3 randomized seeds and 3 more randomized seeds where all battles except the first rival battle are double battles.
Hard Mode seeds give all gym leaders/important trainers 6 Pokemon and a slight level boost.
